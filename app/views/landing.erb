  <div class="intro"><p>From the&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html"> Rails Guide regarding Active Record</a>:</p>
  <p><em>ActiveRecord is a Ruby library for working with Relational SQL Databases like MySQL and Postgres. It provides an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) with these core features: a single Ruby object maps to a database table. Columns are accessed by methods, and are inferred from the database schema. Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. </em></p>
  <p>In other words Active Record is useful for creating tables and models for the data you're using to run, populate, and build your ruby / rails web application. Unfortunately, Active Record magic requires very specific syntax. Often, translating a schema you've built into the models and migrations with this syntax can pose problems (you forget an association, didn't name your table the right thing, etc). These hiccups really stink when they are all that stand between you and your glorious project.</p>
