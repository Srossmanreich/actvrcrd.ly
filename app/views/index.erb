  <p>From the&nbsp<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html"> Rails Guide regarding Active Record</a>:</p>
  <p><em>Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic.</em></p>
  <p>In other words Active Record is useful for creating tables and models for the date you're using to run, populate, and build your web application. Unfortunately, Active Record magic requires very specific syntax. Often, translating a schema you've built into the models and migrations with this syntax can pose problems (you forget an association or didn't name your table the right thing).</p> 
  <p>This tool will solve these syntax hiccups for you</p>
  <h3>You build your schema</h3> 
  <h3> ---- </h3>
  <h3> We give you your Ruby code for your models and migrations in Active Record</h3>

  <p class="center-align">Fill out the form below to create your first table:</p>

  <form class="addtable">
    <p>Table name (e.g., Users, Votes --> keep it simple and keep it plural):</p>
    <p><input type="text" name="tablename"></p>
    <p>NOTE: an ID (integer) will automatically be generated with each table</p>
    <p>Enter a column header:</p>
    <input type="text" name="header">
  </form>
